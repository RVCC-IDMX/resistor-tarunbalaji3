# Resistor

Use the different band, multiplier, and tolerance buttons to get different resistor values

## Band 1

Band one is on the far left. This is your first parameter. Here are the corresponding values:

| Color  | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Black  | 0     |
| Brown  | 1     |
| Red    | 2     |
| Orange | 3     |
| Yellow | 4     |
| Green  | 5     |
| Blue   | 6     |
| Violet | 7     |
| Grey   | 8     |
| White  | 9     |

## Band 2

Band 2 is your second parameter. Here are the corresponding values:

| Color  | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Black  | 0     |
| Brown  | 1     |
| Red    | 2     |
| Orange | 3     |
| Yellow | 4     |
| Green  | 5     |
| Blue   | 6     |
| Violet | 7     |
| Grey   | 8     |
| White  | 9     |

## Multiplier

The multiplier is the third paramter. The values from band 1 and 2 are multipled by this paramter. Here are the corresponding values:

| Color  | Value  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Black  | x1     |
| Brown  | x10    |
| Red    | x100   |
| Orange | x1 k   |
| Yellow | x10 k  |
| Green  | x100 k |
| Blue   | x1 M   |
| Violet | x10 M  |
| Grey   | x100 M |
| White  | x1 G   |
| Gold   | x0.1   |
| Silver | x0.01  |

## Tolerance

The last parameter is tolerance. Here are the corresponding values:

| Color  | Value   |
| ------ | ------- |
| Brown  | ± 1%    |
| Red    | ± 2%    |
| Green  | ± 0.5%  |
| Blue   | ± 0.25% |
| Violet | ± 0.1%  |
| Grey   | ± 0.05% |
| Gold   | ± 5%    |
| Silver | ± 10%   |
